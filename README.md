## Motivations
1. I'm not interested in WebP, But often annoyed with WebP format files on Browsing. So I made D&D easy converter of WebP image files.
2. Using C++(MFC), std::thread, mutex and messaging, I tried to make substantial project of multithread.

## How To Use
1. Download from latest version. https://github.com/aymspecial/WebpDropConverter/releases

3. Double Click!!
